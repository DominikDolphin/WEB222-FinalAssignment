                        In this project, I needed to make my website follow the concept of Responsive Design. Essentially what this implies is that regardless of the device a user is using, they will have a user friendly design. In my Assignment 5, I hardcoded all my code in
                        pure css, and made the body a width of 1100px. This approach of sizing the body was essentially perfect for when a client used it on a computer or a laptop. However, as soon as the user opens the webpage on their mobile device,
                        the entire website was unusable since everything was squished together. The texts were overlapping each other as well as the images. I wanted to use my previous assignment and simply edit the code to fit the responsive design instruction.
                        Unfortunately, after around 30 minutes of tinkering around, I came to the realization that it would take too long and I would need to reformat my entire code. I then looked at a library provided in Lecture 9 called Bootstrap. I
                        have heard of this library before but never realized the power it holds. Positioning works on a gird of 12. Learning this library took a fair amount of time, I’m still not entirely comfortable using it since there are so many different
                        classes to use. Through several examples in source code examples online and YouTube videos, I understand the basics and was able to work with a class called Card. This card holds all the items that my shop sells with its details
                        (price, description, image, etc..). I made it so that when you use a medium sized monitor, it displays three items per row whereas when it’s on a phone, you simply have one, and just need to scroll down for the next items. This
                        makes it really easy to read for whoever is using the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>For those designing a website, I will always highly recommend taking responsive design seriously before and during the building of the website. It is much harder to convert later on. As in my case, I entirely redid my code. Having
                        accessibility for everyone will without a doubt improve in sales and experience. Virtually everyone has a phone nowadays, people want to stay connected to the services they want and need in any way, shape or form. The younger generations
                        are constantly on their phones, and are big spenders. More accessibility that your website has with quality, the greater the return on a business standpoint.
